## Verdict

**ACCEPT** — Full product-readiness audit complete. Every visible UI control on every route is enumerated and classified. 12 scenarios A-L are mapped to Playwright tests with browser-verified outcomes. **87 / 87 Playwright tests pass** (8 prior spec files + 12 new spec files). Backend xunit suite holds at **137 / 137**. Frontend build clean. No control failed; no `UNKNOWN_NOT_TESTED` remains; no `BROKEN` discovered.

`READY_FOR_SLAVA_MANUAL_RETEST=yes` — the operator can repeat any of the 12 scenarios manually; each one mirrors a passing Playwright test.

---

## What was actually done

1. **Route inventory** — every mounted React Router path enumerated (`route-inventory.md`).
2. **Action inventory** — every visible interactive control on every page + every modal classified into one of 8 status categories (`action-inventory.md`).
3. **Scenario matrix** — 12 scenarios A-L (gate spec) mapped to one or more Playwright tests (`scenario-matrix.md`).
4. **Playwright extension** — 12 new spec files added (`09-*` through `20-*`) covering the gaps the prior gate's 32 tests didn't cover.
5. **Browser-verified persistence** — `18-persistence.spec.ts` creates a customer + a claim, calls `page.reload()`, and confirms the rows survive — proves DB persistence through the actual browser path.
6. **Negative & adversarial pass** — `19-negative.spec.ts` exercises the catch-all redirect, an unknown claim id, empty-required form fields, and explicit "no real payment / no real transfer / no funds transferred" wording absence across 8 routes.
7. **UI resilience pass** — `20-ui-resilience.spec.ts` cancels every major modal cleanly, navigates rapidly between 6 routes, and verifies disabled-future controls are truly non-clickable.
8. **No commit / no push / no Azure** — source repo HEAD unchanged; only handoff repo updated.

## Counts

### Route inventory (from `route-inventory.md`)

- **Mounted routes:** 13 + catch-all redirect = 14
- **Auth-protected:** 13
- **Public:** 1 (`/login`)
- **Disabled-future controls:** 6 (2 sidebar + 4 topbar/dashboard period+segment)

### Action inventory (from `action-inventory.md`)

| Status category | Count |
|---|---:|
| `WORKING_DB_BACKED` | 18 |
| `WORKING_BACKEND_READ_ONLY` | 7 |
| `WORKING_LOCAL_UI_ONLY` | 36 |
| `SAFE_SIMULATION_DB` | 2 |
| `DISABLED_FUTURE_EXPLICIT` | 6 |
| `INTENTIONALLY_READ_ONLY` | 22 |
| `BROKEN` | **0** |

### Scenario matrix (from `scenario-matrix.md`)

| Total scenarios | 12 |
| Covered | **12** |
| Deferred | **0** |
| Partial | **0** |

### Playwright suite (from `e2e-results.md`)

| Metric | Prior gate V0.2 | This gate V0.1 | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Spec files | 8 | 20 | **+12** |
| Test cases | 32 | 87 | **+55** |
| Pass rate | 32 / 32 (100%) | 87 / 87 (100%) | maintained |
| Duration | 102.3 s | 234.0 s | +131.7 s |

---

## BROKEN controls

**None.** No control failed during the audit pass. Every disabled control is intentionally disabled with an explanatory `title` or `aria-disabled="true"` attribute.

## UNKNOWN_NOT_TESTED controls

**None.** Every visible control has at least one browser test or is documented as render-only / display-only in `action-inventory.md`. The intentional no-ops (claims-list date filter, document-preview "originals not stored") are explicitly classified in the inventory.

---

## Fixes made during the audit

The audit pass surfaced **0 product bugs** and **3 test-assertion bugs** (in my own newly-written Playwright tests).

| # | Where | Issue | Fix | Product affected? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `e2e/16-approval-validation.spec.ts:30` | Used regex `/Погодити виплату/` to locate the approve-decision tile. Backend's `getClaimApproval` exposes the label as `"Затвердити виплату"`. Test timed out. | Switched to `[data-selected]` attribute on the tile button + loop until `approve-after-review` enables. Label-agnostic. | NO — pure test selector fix; the underlying UI works correctly. |
| 2 | `e2e/16-approval-validation.spec.ts:41` | Asserted body text `/має бути додатня/` after amount=0 submit. The amount input has HTML5 `min="0.01" required`; browser native validation rejects the submit BEFORE the JS handler sets `setError("Сума виплати має бути додатня.")`. So the JS error text never appeared. | Switched to checking the HTML5 `:invalid` validity state AND that no success toast appears. | NO — the validation actually works; the user observes the native browser tooltip and the modal stays open. Test now matches that observable. |
| 3 | `e2e/20-ui-resilience.spec.ts:18` | Compared `claim-row` count before/after cancelling NewClaimModal. Other serial tests in the same run create claims and the count drifts. | Use a unique never-saved marker string in the form, cancel, then search by that marker and assert the empty-state. Race-safe. | NO — the UI behaves correctly; test was just race-prone. |

After the 3 test fixes, full re-run: **87/87 PASS**.

### Modified (in this gate)

None — the gate spec forbids large redesigns or architecture changes. All bug fixes happened in the *new* Playwright tests, not in the product code. The product code from the prior gate is untouched.

### Source repo state

- HEAD `03725241…` unchanged
- origin/main `69e67312…` unchanged
- 0 staged files
- New gate's outputs are all under `docs/reports/total-ui-exploratory-…/` and `e2e/`
- No commit, no push, no Azure resources created

| Backend build (`dotnet build server/InsuranceAIPlatform.sln`) | PASS — 0 warnings, 0 errors, 10 projects |
| Backend xunit (`dotnet test`) | PASS — 137 / 137 |
| Frontend build (`npm run build`) | PASS — 125 modules, 431.74 kB JS, 39.15 kB CSS |

## Safety scan

| Category | Result |
|---|---|
| Hard-coded secret values | absent in source/new files |
| `sk-ant-` / `sk-or-` / `sk-proj-` substrings in source | absent (only `'sk-ant-'` appears in `07-safety.spec.ts` as the NEGATIVE assertion list, i.e. tests confirm UI does NOT contain that prefix) |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` value in source/logs/reports | absent (only the env-var NAME appears in the safety test forbidden list) |
| Azure SDK references added | 0 |
| `Microsoft.SemanticKernel` / `Azure.AI.OpenAI` / `AddAzureOpenAI` | 0 hits |
| Real PII in new files | absent (all synthetic, `@synthetic.invalid` / `+38050…` patterns) |
| Real payout / customer message paths | absent (verified by `07-safety.spec.ts` + `19-negative.spec.ts` across 8 routes) |
| AI-vendor phrase scan on new docs | clean — only the API-key prefix marker (e.g. `sk-...`) appears in a comment in `07-safety.spec.ts` as the NEGATIVE assertion list (pre-existing from prior gate; the comment merely labels the prefix the safety test scans the UI for) |
| `origin/main` mutated | NO |
| `dev` HEAD mutated by gate commits | NO |
| Any `git push` / `git commit` attempt during gate | NO (to source repo); handoff repo will receive a documentation-only commit in Subphase 17 |
| Production identity / auth users created | NO (demo localStorage flow unchanged) |

## Limitations

1. **Single-browser coverage.** Chromium only. Firefox / WebKit not exercised — portfolio mockup, not multi-browser product.
2. **Claims-list "Date" filter is documented as no-op.** The source data uses a relative-time string ("5 хв") which is not parseable to an ISO timestamp without backend changes. Tracked as Phase-2 polish; out of scope this gate.
3. **AI runs use Mock provider.** The real DeepSeek opt-in path is unchanged from prior gates and is not exercised here (it requires `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` + `AiProvider:RealCallsEnabled=true`).
4. **Audit-trace deep coverage is shallow on category-by-category.** `17-audit.spec.ts` asserts the page renders + no forbidden category appears. It does NOT assert specific row ids per category — DB state varies across runs.
5. **`HybridClaimReadService` still bridges sync→async via `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`.** Inherited from earlier gates. Not addressed here.
6. **No screenshots / traces archived in `gpt-handoff`.** Playwright config: `screenshot: only-on-failure`, `trace: on-first-retry`. With 0 failures and 0 retries, no artifacts emitted. HTML report is local-only.
7. **Test-bugs not product-bugs.** The 3 failures the first run surfaced were in my own new Playwright assertions; the underlying product behaviour was correct. Fixes documented above; not a product regression.

## Blockers

**None.**

## Next safe step

`MANUAL_OPERATOR_BROWSER_CLICK_THROUGH_V4` — operator hands-on repeat of scenarios A-L through the real browser. Should mirror what `e2e/09-*` through `e2e/20-*` automate. ~20-30 min for a thorough operator pass.

After that, candidate gates:
- `COMMIT_AND_PUSH_DEV_REALISTIC_SANDBOX_BATCH` (commit accumulated dev work)
- `DOCS_ARCHITECTURE_DURABLE_COMMIT_V0.1` (commit architecture docs + this gate's inventories)
- `AZURE_READINESS_PRE_FLIGHT_V0.1` (Azure planning doc only)
